# Design Document for Gigapaxos based Replicated Datastore

This project implements a replicated datastore using Gigapaxos Replicated State Machine interface and the only file modified for this part of the assignment is MyDBReplicableAppGP.java which provides application logic that Gigapaxos replicates across the servers. Each replica connects to its own Cassandra keyspace and is created on startup if it does not already exist in there and all the CQL commands delivered through Gigapaxos are executed deterministically against that keyspace because Gigapaxos totally orders all client requests and all replicas apply the same sequence of operations and remain consistent.

The execute method extracts a CQL command from the incoming RequestPacket and submits it to Cassandra and the non CQL requests are safely ignored. A simple request counter tracks how many committed operations have been applied and this metadata is used for checkpointing. The checkpoint method returns a compact string that encodes the keyspace and the request count while the restore method parses this string on startup to reset the counter and cassandra gets the actual table contents so no extra work is needed to restore stored data.

Basically this design meets the requirements of a deterministic replicated application under Gigapaxos and the application executes all operations in order and maintains identical state across replicas and provides meaningful checkpoint and restore functionality. Consistency tests run successfully with this implementation and the replication behavior matches the expectations of the Gigapaxos RSM model.
